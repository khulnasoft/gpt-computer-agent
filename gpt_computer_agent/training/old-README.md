## GPT4All-J: An Apache-2 Licensed GPT4All Model
![gpt4all-j-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13879686/231876409-e3de1934-93bb-4b4b-9013-b491a969ebbc.gif)

Run on an M1 Mac (not sped up!)


### GPT4All-J Chat UI Installers
Installs a native chat-client with auto-update functionality that runs on your desktop with the GPT4All-J model baked into it.

[Mac/OSX](https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-darwin.dmg)

[Windows](https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-win64.exe)

[Ubuntu](https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-linux.run)

If you have older hardware that only supports avx and not avx2 you can use these.

[Mac/OSX - avx-only](https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-darwin-avx-only.dmg)

[Windows - avx-only](https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-win64-avx-only.exe)

[Ubuntu - avx-only](https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-linux-avx-only.run)

These files are not yet cert signed by Windows/Apple so you will see security warnings on initial installation. We did not want to delay release while waiting for their process to complete.

Find the most up-to-date information on the [GPT4All Website](https://gpt4all.io/)

### Raw Model
[ggml Model Download Link](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j.bin)

Note this model is only compatible with the C++ bindings found [here](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all-chat). It will not work with any existing llama.cpp bindings as we had to do a large fork of llama.cpp. GPT4All will support the ecosystem around this new C++ backend going forward.

Python bindings are imminent and will be integrated into this [repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/pyllamacpp). Stay tuned on the [GPT4All discord](https://discord.gg/mGZE39AS3e) for updates.

## Training GPT4All-J

Please see [GPT4All-J Technical Report](https://static.nomic.ai/gpt4all/2023_GPT4All-J_Technical_Report_2.pdf) for details.

### GPT4All-J Training Data

- We are releasing the curated training data for anyone to replicate GPT4All-J here: [GPT4All-J Training Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nomic-ai/gpt4all-j-prompt-generations)
   - [Atlas Map of Prompts](https://atlas.nomic.ai/map/gpt4all-j-prompts-curated)
   - [Atlas Map of Responses](https://atlas.nomic.ai/map/gpt4all-j-response-curated)
   
We have released updated versions of our `GPT4All-J` model and training data. 

- `v1.0`: The original model trained on the v1.0 dataset
- `v1.1-breezy`: Trained on a filtered dataset where we removed all instances of AI language model
- `v1.2-jazzy`: Trained on a filtered dataset where we also removed instances like I'm sorry, I can't answer... and AI language model

The [models](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/gpt4all-j) and [data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nomic-ai/gpt4all-j-prompt-generations) versions can be specified by passing a `revision` argument.

For example, to load the `v1.2-jazzy` model and dataset, run:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

dataset = load_dataset("nomic-ai/gpt4all-j-prompt-generations", revision="v1.2-jazzy")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("nomic-ai/gpt4all-j-prompt-generations", revision="v1.2-jazzy")
```

### GPT4All-J Training Instructions

```bash
accelerate launch --dynamo_backend=inductor --num_processes=8 --num_machines=1 --machine_rank=0 --deepspeed_multinode_launcher standard --mixed_precision=bf16  --use_deepspeed --deepspeed_config_file=configs/deepspeed/ds_config_gptj.json train.py --config configs/train/finetune_gptj.yaml
```


# Original GPT4All Model (based on GPL Licensed LLaMa)



![gpt4all-lora-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13879686/228352356-de66ca7a-df70-474e-b929-2e3656165051.gif)

Run on M1 Mac (not sped up!)

# Try it yourself

Here's how to get started with the CPU quantized GPT4All model checkpoint:

1. Download the `gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin` file from [Direct Link](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/nomic-ai/gpt4all/gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin) or [[Torrent-Magnet]](https://tinyurl.com/gpt4all-lora-quantized).
2. Clone this repository, navigate to `chat`, and place the downloaded file there.
3. Run the appropriate command for your OS:
   - M1 Mac/OSX: `cd chat;./gpt4all-lora-quantized-OSX-m1`
   - Linux: `cd chat;./gpt4all-lora-quantized-linux-x86`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `cd chat;./gpt4all-lora-quantized-win64.exe`
   - Intel Mac/OSX: `cd chat;./gpt4all-lora-quantized-OSX-intel`

For custom hardware compilation, see our [llama.cpp](https://github.com/zanussbaum/gpt4all.cpp) fork.

Find all compatible models in the GPT4All Ecosystem section.

[Secret Unfiltered Checkpoint](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/nomic-ai/gpt4all/gpt4all-lora-unfiltered-quantized.bin) - [[Torrent]](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/nomic-ai/gpt4all/gpt4all-lora-unfiltered-quantized.bin.torrent)

This model had all refusal to answer responses removed from training. Try it with:
- M1 Mac/OSX: `cd chat;./gpt4all-lora-quantized-OSX-m1 -m gpt4all-lora-unfiltered-quantized.bin`
- Linux: `cd chat;./gpt4all-lora-quantized-linux-x86 -m gpt4all-lora-unfiltered-quantized.bin`
- Windows (PowerShell): `cd chat;./gpt4all-lora-quantized-win64.exe -m gpt4all-lora-unfiltered-quantized.bin`
- Intel Mac/OSX: `cd chat;./gpt4all-lora-quantized-OSX-intel -m gpt4all-lora-unfiltered-quantized.bin`
-----------
Note: the full model on GPU (16GB of RAM required) performs much better in our qualitative evaluations.

# Python Client
## CPU Interface
To run GPT4All in python, see the new [official Python bindings](https://github.com/khulnasoft/pyllamacpp).

The old bindings are still available but now deprecated. They will not work in a notebook environment.
To get running using the python client with the CPU interface, first install the [nomic client](https://github.com/khulnasoft/nomic) using `pip install nomic`
Then, you can use the following script to interact with GPT4All:
```
from nomic.gpt4all import GPT4All
m = GPT4All()
m.open()
m.prompt('write me a story about a lonely computer')
```

## GPU Interface
There are two ways to get up and running with this model on GPU.
The setup here is slightly more involved than the CPU model.
1. clone the nomic client [repo](https://github.com/khulnasoft/nomic) and run `pip install .[GPT4All]` in the home dir.
2. run `pip install nomic` and install the additional deps from the wheels built [here](https://github.com/khulnasoft/nomic/tree/main/bin)

Once this is done, you can run the model on GPU with a script like the following:
```
from nomic.gpt4all import GPT4AllGPU
m = GPT4AllGPU(LLAMA_PATH)
config = {'num_beams': 2,
          'min_new_tokens': 10,
          'max_length': 100,
          'repetition_penalty': 2.0}
out = m.generate('write me a story about a lonely computer', config)
print(out)
```
Where LLAMA_PATH is the path to a Huggingface Automodel compliant LLAMA model.
Nomic is unable to distribute this file at this time.
We are working on a GPT4All that does not have this limitation right now.

You can pass any of the [huggingface generation config params](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationConfig) in the config.

> 1. The title of your movie plot should be "The Last Stand". 
> 2. The summary of your movie plot should be: A group of mercenaries are hired to protect a small town from a dangerous criminal who is on the run. However, the town's sheriff is not willing to let them take over and decides to take matters into his own hands.

### Reverse a string in python.
> In Python, you can reverse a list or tuple by using the reversed() function on it. Here's an example of how to use this method with strings: 
>    ```python
>   my_string = "Hello World" # Define your original string here
>   reversed_str = my_string[::-1]   # Use a slice and negative index for reverse order
>   print(reversed_str)     # Output will be reversed version of the inputted string.

> In iambic pentameter,<br>
> The mighty Roman emperor<br>
> Fell into a salad of lettuce and croutons,<br>
> His empire crumbling around him,<br>
> As he was devoured by the hungry diners.<br>
> The once mighty emperor<br>
> Was now just a salad topping,<br>
> His legacy reduced to a mere garnish,<br>
> As he was consumed by the masses.<br>
> The fall of Julius Caesar into a caesar salad,<br>
> In iambic pentameter,<br>
> Was a tragic end to a great man,<br>
> Who had once ruled the world with an iron fist.<br>
> But now, he was just a salad topping,<br>
> His legacy reduced to a mere garnish,<br>
> As he was consumed by the masses.
